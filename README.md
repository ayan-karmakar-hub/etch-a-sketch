/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a simple sketch pad. The main goal was to
familiarize myself more with Javascript. I utiized functions, event 
listeners, and css styling to manipulate DOM nodes I created (all
withing a JavaScript file).

It certainly would have been a lot cleaner to split up the work between
separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, but I think this project gave 
me a good understanding of exactly what JavaScript is capable of doing.

/******** Relevant Files *********/

index.html: A basic html skeleton. I did almost all the work in JavaScript;

sketch.js: This file was the workhorse for this project. It added all the
    html,css and javascript I needed to complete this assignment. It is
    responsible for resetting the board and changing the square size.
